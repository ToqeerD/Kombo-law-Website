                                There are many temporary immigration categories that allow foreign nationals to engage in employment in the United States. These employment visas are for people looking to work in the United States for a fixed period of time.
                            </p>
                            <p>Most often, a potential employer files a petition for this type of work with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) before coming to the United States the employee would still need to apply for a visa. Please note, that spouses and family of holders of these employment visas must file for their own visas prior to coming to the U.S.</p>

The academic institution in which you have been accepted and plan on attending must be approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP). Basically, it needs to be accredited to be able to accept foreign students on F-1 visas.

                            <p>The good news is that you will be able to work, but because this is a nonimmigrant visa, so, there will be restrictions on where you can work and the type of work. Lastly, your spouse and children can come with you, however, they will not be permitted to work, but your children can enroll in schools. Your children and spouse will be on F-2 visas and linked to your visa status.</p>
                            <p>The requirements for an F-1 visa are the following:</p>
